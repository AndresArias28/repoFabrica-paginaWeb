                        <h3><b>Bugatti Chiron</b></h3>
                        <p> The Chiron utilises a carbon fibre body structure, independent suspension and a Haldex All-wheel drive system. The carbon fibre body has a stiffness of 50,000 Nm per degree.</p>
                        <p> The Chiron can accelerate from 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) in 2.4 seconds according to the manufacturer. In a world-record-setting test at the time in 2017, the Chiron reached 400 km/h (249 mph) in 32.6 seconds, after which it needed 9.4 seconds to brake to standstill</p>

                        <p> The Roadster model was announced for production on 27 December 2012. Equipped with the same V12 engine as the coupé, Lamborghini claimed that it could accelerate from 0–97 km/h (0–60 mph) in 2.9 seconds and would achieve a top speed of 349 km/h (217 mph).</p>
                        <p> The removable roof consisted of two carbon fibre panels weighing 6 kg (13 lb) each, which required the reinforcement of the rear pillar to compensate for the loss of structural integrity and accommodate the rollover protection and ventilation systems for the engine.</p>

It featured an upgraded powertrain, with maximum power output increased to 750 PS (552 kW; 740 hp) from the standard coupé's 700 PS (515 kW; 690 hp). Combined with a weight reduction of 50 kg (110 lb) from increased usage of carbon fibre both inside and out, the SV had a power-to-weight ratio of 1 hp to 2 kg</p>
